NOTES.

I. Games invented by the Lydians.

1. 
Φασὶν οἱ Λυδοὶ, κ.τ.λ] As a matter of fact, most of the games mentioned were of much greater antiquity than is
implied; but Herodotus very properly abstains from spoiling a good story by disputing the accuracy of its details.

3. 
Μάνεω] a genitive employed in Ionic Greek from nouns in -ης of the first declension. Manes was the mythical founder and earliest king of the Lydian nation, as Romulus was of the Roman.

4. 
ἀνὰ τὴν Λυδίαν πᾶσαν] See note on XI. B, §5, 1. 15.

λιπαροῦντες] The sense of the word in this passage, for which see Vocabulary, is not that which it bears in ordinary Attic Greek, viz., ‘to beseech earnestly.’

5. 
μετὰ] adverbial = ἔπειτα.

6. 
ἄλλος ἄλλο ἐπεμηχανᾶτο] ‘one man devised one remedy, one another.’ Ἄλλος succeeded by a second ἄλλος (or any part of it) in different clauses =‘one ... one’ or ‘one ... another,’ but when the word is repeated, as above, in the same clause, we cannot translate literally. Such a phrase is really a shortened form for ἄλλος ἄλλο ἐπεμηχανᾶτο, ἄλλος ἄλλο ἐπεμηχανᾶτο. Compare Latin ‘alius aliud facit.’

7. 
ἀστραγάλων] This game, which resembled that of dice, was originally played with knucklebones, but afterwards with more elaborate instruments. The ‘astragali’ differed from the ‘cubi’ or dice proper, in having only four sides flat and marked, the other two being rounded. The methods of playing’ the two games were also dissimilar.

9.
πεσσῶν] The game of πεσσοί, resembling our draughts or chess, is said to have been known in Egypt as early as 2000 B.c. It was popular among the Greeks; and Pindar, a celebrated poet who composed choral songs, represents, the heroes in Elysium as amusing themselves with the game.

10. 
πρὸς τὸν λίμον.] lit. ‘against their hunger,’ i.e, ‘to stave off their hunger.”

 
II. The Oldest Race on Earth.

7. 
πόρον etc.] ‘find out any solution to this question (namely) who were’ etc. Notice the two negatives οὐκ...οὐδένα, which, in Greek, strengthen instead of cancelling each other; cf. 1. 10, μηδένα...μηδεμίαν.

11. 
ἐφ' ἑαυτῶν] ‘by themselves,” Ἐπὶ, lit. upon, is often used with the genitive to denote ‘place where’; hence with a person it frequently means ‘in the presence of’; thus ἐφ' ἑαυτῶν = ‘in their own presence,’ i.e. ‘alone, by themselves.”

12.
πλήσαντα δὲ τοῦ γαλ.] ‘having satisfied (them) with the milk.’ Πίμπλημι, like the adjectives πλέως, πλήρης and the Latin plenus, ‘full,’ is followed by the genitive of the substance with which a thing is filled.

14. 
ῥήξουσι] Pres. indicative for the optative, cf. on VIII. A, §3, 1.7.

21. 
πολὺ ἦν] ‘was often-repeated.’

25. 
καλοῦντας τὸν ἄρτον, supply βέκος, ‘found that the Phrygians called bread by that name.’

 

III. Crocodiles in Egypt. 

4.
ἑκάτεροι] in the plural signifies ‘each set, or group, of people.” 

17. 
κατὰ τὴν φωνήν] lit. ‘down to the cry,’ ie., ‘in the direction of the ery.’

11. 
ἄγραι] ‘modes of catching’ for which ἁλώσεις might be used in Attic prose. In the Attic writers ἄγρα is rather ‘the act of catching,’ or ‘the chase.’

14. 
ἄγκιστρον] an old word for ‘a hook,’ is retained in Attic only in the special sense of the hook of a spindle.

18. 
οἱ δὲ] ‘and they’ (cf. on VIII. A, §1, 16, for this usage of ὁ when followed by μέν or δέ), i.e., the men on the bank, though in 1. 14 and 1. 15 only one man is mentioned.

20. 
κατέπλασεν] the ‘gnomic’ aorist, to be translated in English by the present tense; see on ΙΧ. (c) 1. 13.


IV. Story or Mycerinus.

1. 
τοῦ πατρὸς.] Cheops by name, who closed all the temples and terribly oppressed his subjects by forcing them to give up their usual occupations (ἔργα in 1. 3), in order to carry on enormous building operations of his own.

6,7. 
πρῶτον...ἤρξεν...ἀποθανοῦσα] “the death of his daughter first began his troubles,’ lit. ‘his daughter having died” Cf. urbs capta = ‘the captuire of the city.‘’

13. 
πάτρως]
Chephren, who succeeded his brother Cheops, and followed his bad example.

23. 
ὡς κατακεκριμένων...τούτων] For ὡς with the genitive absolute see on VIII. B, §3, 1. 15; the force of it here is ‘feeling, or recognising that this fate had now been absolutely decreed against him,’ i.e., he saw that it was no use to expostulate further in the hope of obtaining a reprieve.

24.
ποιησάμενος] Notice the force of the middle voice, “getting made for his use.’

25.
ὅπως γίγνοιτο νύξ] ‘whenever night came on.’ The optative expresses indefinite frequency in the past.

27. 
ἵνα γῆς κ.τ.λ.] ‘wherever in the land he heard that there were the most suitable places for revelry.’ γῆς is a partitive genitive, ἵνα γῆς being equivalent to our ‘where on earth.’ The optative πυνθάνοιτο is again one of indefinite frequency in past time. 

29, 30.
οἱ...γένοιτο] dativus commodi, ‘that there might be for him,’ ‘that he might have.’

V. Stories of Amasis.

(a.)
1. 
Ἀπρίου ὧδε καθῃρ] The Egyptians had revolted against King Apries, and when he sent his officer Amasis to persuade them to return to their allegiance, the rebels suddenly offered to make Amasis their king. He assented to this, defeated Apries who was supported by his mercenaries, and succeeded to the throne. He was anxious to deal mercifully with the captive monarch, but was forced to sacrifice him to the anger of the Egyptians, who put him to death.

1,2. 
Τὰ πρῶτα] adverbial, more commonly πρῶτον, without the article.

3,4.
ἅτε..ὄντα, ‘inasmuch as he was.’ See vocab. ἅτε.

4. 
μετὰ δὲ σοφίᾳ, etc.] ‘but afterwards by skilful dealing instead of indiscretion he won them over.’

6. 
ἄλλα τε ἀγαθὰ μυρ. καὶ] ‘he had, beside a host of other fine possessions, a golden, etc.’ See on XI. B, §1, 1. 23.

8. 
κατακόψας] ‘cutting to pieces’; κατὰ compounded with a verb often has an intensifying force, lit. ‘right down to the end.’ In English on the contrary we speak of ‘cutting up.’

14,15. 
ἐνεμοῖεν...ἐναπονίζοιντο...σέβοιντο] optative because the relative clause in which the verbs occur is in oratio obliqua, Before τότε σέβοιντο we must supply ὅν from ἐς ὅν.

ἔφη λέγων, ‘he went on to say.’

16. 
αὐτὸς...πεπραγέναι] nominative with the infinitive as referring to the subject of the principle verb. Notice that when a verb has a second or strong perfect it is regularly intransitive. Thus πέπραγα = I have fared; πέπραχα, ‘I have done, or transacted.’ Cf. ὄλωλα, I have perished; ὀλώλεκα, ‘I have destroyed.’

17. 
εἴη] optative because in oratio obliqua.


(b.)
3. 
μέχρι πληθούσ. ἀγορᾶς] ‘until the filling of the market,’ a technical term for one of the four divisions of the day, which are elsewhere given by Herod. as follows, ὄρθος, the early morning; ἀγορᾶς πληθούσης (or πληθυούσης), forenoon μεσημβρία, noontide; ἀκοκλινομένη ἡμέρα, the decline of the day.

4,5. 
τὸ ἀπὸ τοῦδε] ‘thenceforth,’ adverbial.

9.
προύστηκας] = προ-έστηκας. τὸ ἄγαν φλαῦρον, ‘too much frivolity,’ ‘an excess of frivolity.’ Auverbs preceded by the article are often employed in Greek as if they were adjectives, e.g. οἱ νῦν ἄνδρες, ‘the men of the present day’; ὁ πρὶν χρόνος, ‘the former time.’

10, 11. 
χρῆν...πράττειν] ‘you ought to transact (but you don't),’ Lit. 'It would be your duty (if you did what was right)’, for χρῆν...πράττειν is really the apodosis of an unfulfilled condition, the protasis being implied; the particle ἄν, which is almost invariably required in such cases, is usually omitted with the imperfects χρῆν (or ἐχρῆν), ἔδει, and a few other verbs.

13. 
ἤκουες] Intransitive, see Vocab. ἀκούω.

19, 20. 
τὸ μέρος] adverbial, ‘in turn.’


(c.) 
4. 
ἔκλεπτεν ἄν, ἦγον ἄν] ‘he used to steal,’ ‘they used to bring him,’ etc. The imperfect or aorist indicative are sometimes used with ἄν, in what is called an ‘iterative’ sense, i.e. to express repeated action in the past. It is supposed that the construction is the protasis of a conditional sentence of the type employed to express unfulfilled condition, thus, ἔπραξα ἂν = ‘(If I ever had had a chance) I would have done it’ i.e. ‘I did it whenever I got the chance,’ ‘I constantly did it.’ In such cases the imperfect is distinguished from the aorist as implying that the repeated action is also continuous; thus ἔκλεπτεν ἂν περιϊων, ‘he used to go round on a thieving raid.’

9. 
Ἐπεὶ...ἐβασίλευσε] ‘When he had become king, see on VIII. B, §3. 1. 10, and compare the succeeding words ὅσοι...ἀπέλυσαν.

12. 
ὡς...οὖσιν, ‘regarding them as,’ etc. Cf. on VIII. B, §3, 1. 15.


VI.  Story of Arion the Lyric Poet.

1. 
Ἀπίων] See Vocabulary of proper names.

κιθαρῳδός] derived from κιθάρα (whence the word ‘guitar’) ‘a lyre,’ and ᾄδειν ‘to sing,’ signifies ‘one who sings to the lyre,’ hence ‘a lyric poet,’ for in early times such poets not only composed poems capable of being set to music, but composed the music also, and sang their own songs to the lyre.

τὸν πολὺν τοῦ χρόνου] ‘the greater part of his time.’ Notice the usage, partly adjectival, partly substantival, of πολὺς and also of ἥμισυς accompanied by the article; they are sub- stantival inasmuch as they have a noun in the genitive case (τοῦ χρόνου in this instance) dependent upon them; and they are also adjectival since they agree in gender with their noun, e.g. ἡ πολλὴ τῆς νήσου, ‘half the island,’ τὸ ἥμισυ τοῦ τείχους, ‘half the wall.’

2. 
Περιάνδρῳ] See Vocab. of proper names. A favorable feature in the government of the Greek tyrants was the patronage they afforded to literature and art, and to poets in particular. Periander at Corinth, Polycrates at Samos, Pisistratus and his sons at Athens, Hiero at Syracuse, entertained the most distinguished poets of their day at their courts.

3. 
Ἰταλίαν τε καὶ Σικελίαν] In visiting these countries Arion was not going among a foreign people. For the coasts of Sicily and of Southern Italy were lined with cities founded by colonists from Greek states, and it was among these Greek-speaking cities that Arion displayed his poetical and musical talents. So numerous and important were these colonies in Southern Italy that the whole region acquired the name of Magna Graecia.

6. 
οὐδαμοῖς] This word is frequent in Herodotus, but is not employed in later Greek authors, who use οὐδένες in a similar manner.

12,13. 
τὴν ταχίστην] adverbial accusative, supply ὁδόν — ‘the quickest way,’ ‘as quickly as possible.’

21. 
νόμον τὸν ὄρθιον] ‘the Orthian Nome.’ The Νόμος or Nome was the name of a particular kind of religious song, accompanied by the lyre, and appropriated to the worship of Apollo, The ‘Orthian Nome’ was one written in a particular kind of metre known as the ὄρθιος.

22.
ὡς εἶχε] ‘just as he was,’ the verb being used in its intransitive signification, as in the phrase ἀνακῶς εἶχεν below in 1. 29.

25. 
ὡς λέγουσι] ‘as they (indefinite) say,’ ‘as the story goes.”

29,30. 
Ὡς δὲ ἄρα παρῆσαν] ‘when they really came.” Arion had no doubt declared, in confirmation of his story, that the sailors would soon arrive at Corinth; but Periander did not believe him, so that the particle ἄρα is appropriate, implying as it frequently does that a thing happens contrary to expectation. Cf. on VIII. A, §3, 1. 3.

31,32. 
περὶ Ἰταλίαν] ‘somewhere in Italy,’ he was travelling round from city to city.
 

VII. Story or Euenius. 

(a.) 
1. 
ἡλιου πρόβατα] flocks sacred to the sun are mentioned in several passages in early Greek writers, in one of which they are said to number 350, corresponding perhaps to an old reckoning of the days of the year.

4. 
ἐνιαυτὸν] accus. of duration of time.

4,5. 
περὶ πολλοῦ δὴ ποιοῦνται] ‘esteem very highly.’ See on XI. B, §2, 1. 10.

11.
εἶχε σιγῇ] The verb is of course intransitive, ‘kept in a state of silence,’ ‘held his peace.’

14. 
ὑπαγαγόντες...ὑπὸ δικασ.] We say ‘before’ the court, or judge, and in Greek the more common preposition is εἰς but ὑπὸ is employed in this passage somewhat as sub in the Latin ‘sub judice,’ ‘under the consideration or decision of the judge.”

(b.) 
1.
Ἐπεὶ ἐξετύφλωσαν] pluperfect signification, cf. on VIII. B, §3, 1. 10. 

2. 
σφι] dativus commodi, ‘did not bear for them.’ 

5. 
οἱ θεοί] used for the priest or priestess at the oracles who were supposed to speak the words with which the god inspired them. It is mentioned on x. ad fin., that the authorities presiding over the oracles were usually staunch upholders of morality, etc.; similarly in this instance they condemn the blinding of Euenius as cruel and excessive.

7.
οὐ πρότερόν τε] τε is placed third instead of second, because οὐ πρότερόν form practically a single word.

8. 
πρὶν ἂν] with the subjunctive = ‘until,’ is only used after a negative clause.

(c.)
1. 
ἥν ἔχοντα] transl. ‘on the possession of which.’

2 
With προὔθεσαν (= προ-ἐθεσαν) understand τὰ χρηστήρια as object, ‘Consigned them to certain citizens to carry out.’

3. 
σφι] dativus commodi, ‘for the Apolloniates.’

5. 
κατέβαινον συλλυπούμενοι] ‘they went on to console.’ The verb κατέβαινον implies that they at length approached the subject which they really wanted to discuss, the preposition κατά expressing metaphorically gradual descent to a point aimed at.

5,6.
ταυτῇ ὑπαγαγόντες] ‘leading him on in this manner.’ ταυτῇ is adverbial, ὁδῷ being understood, ‘by this way.’ ὑπό compounded with a verb very often, as in this case, implies secrecy or deception.

16. 
δεινὰ ἐποιεῖτο] ‘regarded it as a shameful concern’; for δεινὰ see on XII. 1. 11.

17. 
ὡς έξαπατηθείς] ‘feeling that he had been cheated’; see on VIII. B., §3, 1. 15.

18. 
ἔμφυτον μαντ.] ‘a naturally-inspired power of prophecy,’ in contrast to the same power acquired by education in the technicalities of signs and omens.

 

VII. Story of Cyrus. 
A. Infancy of Cyrus. 
§1.

1. 
Μάγων] The Magi formed the priesthood of the Medes. They retained their priestly functions even after the Persians had secured the dominion, although they were ardent supporters of the Medes during the struggle for supremacy. The English word ‘magic’ is derived from their name since they claimed to possess supernatural powers.

6. 
τοιάδε] ‘such things as follow’; whereas τοιαῦτα means ‘such things as mentioned.’ There is the same distinction between τάδε and ταῦτα, ὧδε and οὕτως, etc.

7. 
πρᾶγμα ὅ ἂν προσθῶ] ‘whatever task I shall impose upon you,’ The relative is accompanied by ἄν and followed by the subjunctive to express futurity. We might have had simply ὃ προστίθημι, i.e. ‘the particular task I am now imposing on you’; but the king wishes to prepare Harpagus beforehand, as it were, for some unpleasant mission.

8. 
ἐς σεαυτοῦ] ‘to your own house,’ understand οἰκίαν, or some similar word. This is a familiar construction not only in Greek but also in English, e.g. ‘I went to Mr. Thompson's,’ ‘I was at Mr. Thompson's,’

9. 
μετὰ] Adverbial; see vocab.

10. 
φίλον] supply ἐστί σοι, ‘If it is pleasing to thee.’

10,11. 
χρὴ δὴ τό γ' ἐμὸν ὑπη] ‘It is surely right that my service should be performed.’ etc. A peculiar usage of ὑπηρετεῖν in the passive, which is hardly to be imitated.

13. 
τὰ οἰκία] Both Greeks and Romans were fond of using, a plural word to signify the collection of buildings which together made up a rich man’s ‘house.’ Cf. aedes in Latin, and the custom of employing domus, sedes, etc., in the plural. The word for ‘house’ in Attic Greek is ἡ οἰκία.

16. 
Ὁ δὲ] Notice that before μέν and δέ, ὁ, ἡ, τό, can stand alone without a noun. In such cases it is not the definite article, but a demonstrative pronoun, ‘he, she, it,’ etc. This is indeed its original meaning, its usage as a definite article ‘the’ not being found in early Greek literature.

16,17. 
Οὐδ' εἰ...οὐκ In such cases the second negative repeats and strengthens the first; it must, however, be omitted in translation, since of course in English two negatives cancel each other and are equivalent to an affirmative.

20. 
αὐτῷ μοι] Observe the distinction between this form and ἐμαυτῷ. The latter is the reflexive pronoun, referring tο the subject of the verb, whereas αὐτῷ μοι is simply the emphatic ‘me myself.’

24.
τὸ ἐντεῦθεν] adverbial ‘in the future.’
ἐμοί] Dative with ἀσφαλείας, ‘security to myself,’ ‘my own security.’

26,27. 
τινὰ τῶν Ἀστ.] ‘one of Astyages’ servants.’

§2.
1,2. 
βουκόλον τινὰ τῶν Ἀστ.] ‘a certain herdsman from among the servants of Astyages.’

7. 
ὅπως ἂν διαφθαρείη] To express purpose after a primary tense ὅπως may Pec with the subjunctive or sometimes with the future indicative. In this passage the place of the future indicative is taken by the optative with ἄν, a construction which expresses futurity of a less distinct or certain nature, and which is really the apodosis of a conditional sentence, some sort of protasis being always expressed or implied. In many cases where there is no uncertainty at all, and where in English we use the simple future indicative, Greek is fond of using the vague or uncertain construction (i.e. the optative with ἄν), especially in reference to anything unpleasant. Translate, ‘so that he may be likely to perish as soon as possible.’ In this case the protasis or condition implied is something of this kind, ‘If nothing unforeseen should happen.’

10. 
ἐκκειμένον] supply τὸ παιδίον.


§3.
2. 
τὴν αὐτὴν ὁδόν] Cognate accusatives after ῃει, ‘he went the same way.’

3. 
ἄρα] (which must be carefully distinguished from ἆρα) usually implies that something happens contrary to expectation. It may often be translated ‘so then,’ or ‘after all,’ but in this and other passages we must use some such phrase as ‘strange to say,’ or ‘It so chanced that.’

7,8. 
ὅ μὴ ἰδεῖν ὤφελον] ‘that which I would that I had not seen.’ Ὤφελον, lit. ‘I ought,’ is used with the present and aorist infinitive to express a wish which cannot be fulfilled. The present and aorist infinitive (usually distinguished merely as ‘continuous’ and ‘momentary’ respectively) have in this case the full temporal force of present and past time, the former implying a wish that something could take place now, the latter that something had happened on a past occasion. 
οἶκος μὲν πᾶς, κ.τ.λ.] It is rare to find a sentence in Greek not introduced by some connecting particle, such as γάρ or δέ. In this instance the description is rendered more graphic by its omission. 

13, 14. 
εἴη...ποιήσαιμι] The optative is employed because the herdsman is repeating Harpagus’ words in oratio obliqua. 

17. 
ὡς ἄρα] ‘that it was actually,’ etc. Cf. above on 1. 3. 

18. 
ὅδε not οὗτος because he has not yet shown the child. Cf. on §1, 1. 6.


§4
3.
λαβομένη τῶν γονάτων τοῦ ἀνδρός] not ‘clasping the knees of her husband,’ but ‘clasping her husband by the knees.’ λαβέσθαι in this sense takes the genitive both of the person and of the part taken hold of.

4,5. 
οὐκ ἔφη οἶός τε εἶναι] ‘said he was not able.’ οὐκ, which really negatives the dependent clause, is always attached to φημί in this way, so that οὔ φημι acquires the sense of the Latin nego, ‘I deny.’ In Greek composition φημί...οὐκ should be avoided, just as dico...non in Latin.

7. 
ἐάν μὴ ποιήσῃ] Strictly speaking the optative is required, since the whole sentence is dependent on the past tense ἔφη; but the employment of the mood actually used in oratio recta by the herdsman adds life and reality to the narrative. Such constructions are very common in Greek.

9. 
ὧδε] ‘thus,’ referring to what follows; οὕτως, ‘thus,’ referring to what has gone before. Cf. on §1, 1. 6.

10. 
πᾶσα ἀνάγκη] supply ἐστί, ‘it is absolutely necessary.’

14,15. 
οὔτε ἡμῖν...ἔσται] ‘we shall have adopted an excellent plan,’ lit. ‘it will not have been badly planned by us,’ βεβουλευμένον ἔσται being used impersonally.

14. 
ἡμιν] The agent is expressed in Greek by the dative case after the perfect or future-perfect passive, and after the verbals in -τέος, -τέον; in other cases by ὑπὸ with the genitive.

26,27.
εἶδε διὰ τούτων] ‘had him seen by means of them.’ Cf. above, §1, 1. 24, κτείνει δι' ἐμοῦ, ‘is having him put to death by my agency.’ Similarly in English we can say, ‘He did it by proxy.’

B. The Boyhood of Cyrus. 

§1.
1.
δεκαέτης] In Attic Greek this word signifies not ‘ten years old,’ but ‘ten years long.’

4.
τὸν τοῦ βουκ. ἐπίκ. παῖδα] ‘the son of the herdsman as he was called.’ ἐπίκλησιν an adverbial accusative (see Vocab.).

6,7. 
ὀφθαλμὸν βασιλέως] evidently a familiar oriental expression, implying a confidential servant used by the king for secret inspection of his subjects and kingdom. The Lexicon states that a Chinese state-paper of 1834 speaks of the British superintendent as ‘the Barbarian eye.’

7. ὡς] which can hardly be translated, accompanies phrases implying distribution.

13. 
ἐπεὶ τάχιστα] ‘as soon as ever’; Latin, quum primum.

15. 
ὡς εἶχε] see Vocab. ἔχω.


§2.
7,8. 
ταῦτα τοῦτον ἐποίησα] ‘treated him in this manner.’ In this sense ποιεῖν can take a double accusative; but in Attic Greek it is more usual to find an adverb and the accusative of the person only, thus κακῶς or εὖ ποιεῖν τινα.

12. 
ἐσ ὅ] ‘until,’ lit. ‘until which (time).’

16. 
ἀνάγνωσις] ‘recognition.’ In Attic its signification is ‘reading’; for ‘recognition’ ἀναγνώρισις is used.

16,17. 
ὁ χαρακτὴρ...ἑαυτὸν] ‘the character of the boy's features appeared to resemble his own’ (Astyages’), lit. ‘to resemble him.’ Similarly Byron writes—
“There be none of Beauty's daughters 
With a magic like thee,” 
meaning like thine.

17. 
προσφέρεσθαι] ‘to resemble.’ This usage is only found in Herod., but the adjective προσφερής, ‘resembling,’ is not uncommon. 

23.
ταῦτα ποιήσω] ‘I will settle this matter.’

24.
πέμπει] ‘sends away.’ Ἀποπέμπει is more usual in this sense.

26. 
Ἐπεὶ...ὑπελέλειπτο] The pluperfect with ἐπεί, ὡς, ἐπειδή, meaning ‘after,‘’ is not nearly so common as the aorist, and the construction should not be imitated.

27. 
τάδε] ‘the following questions.’

30. 
οὐκ ἔφη] Cf. above on A, §4, 1. 4.

31. 
ἄμαλέγων ἐσήμαινε] ‘while saying these words, he at the same time gave a sign, etc.’ In such cases Greek usually connects ἅμα with the participial clause, while in English the corresponding adverb is taken with the principle verb.

35. 
αὐτόν] i.e. Astyages.


§3.
1.
τοῦ βουκόλου...ἐκφήναντος] probably not genitive absolute, but simply dependent on λόγον, ‘took less account of the herdsman, after he had revealed the truth.’

8.
ἵνα μὴ ἐλεγχόμενος ἁλισκηται] ‘that he might not be confuted and detected (in deception).’

10. 
ἤκουσεν. This aorist should be translated by the English pluperfect. The distinction between these two past tenses is by no means always observed in Greek, especially with ὡς, ‘after,’ ἐπειδή, etc. Cf. above on §2, 1. 26.

12.
λέγων ὡς, ‘περίεστι κ.τ.λ’] The conjunctions ὡς and ὅτι are used to introduce oratio obliqua, corresponding to the English ‘that.’ They are, however, not uncommonly used, as in the present passage, to introduce oratio recta also, and in such cases they must be omitted in translation.

15,16. 
Ὡς...μεθεστηκυίας] Ὡς is often attached in this manner to the participle to imply that the statement is not necessarily one of fact but of conception. It may be rendered ‘thinking that,’ ‘on the ground that,’ or in some cases ‘on the pretence that.’

16,17. 
τοῦτο μὲν...τοῦτο δὲ] adverbial; see Vocab.

18,19.
πάρισθί μοι ἐπὶ δεῖπνον] Notice that πάρειμι, strictly speaking ‘I am present,’ is often, as in this instance used in the sense of ‘I come to,’ and therefore can be followed by εἰς or ἐπί with the accusative, as if it were a verb of motion.

21,22. 
οἱ εἰς δ. ἐγεγ.] ‘had turned out well for him.’ Οἱ, dativus commodi.

22. 
τὴν ταχίστην] adverbial; see Vocab.

24. 
ἐς Ἀστυάγους] See above on A, §1, 1. 8.


§4.
11. 
ὅ βούλεται αὐτῶν] The present indicative used for purposes of graphic description, where we should expect the optative, as being in oratio obliqua. Similarly ὃ ἂν with the Present subjunctive is used in 1. 16, after ἔφη. Cf. above on A, §3, 1. 7. Αὐτων, partitive genitive, ‘whatever parts of them he wished.’
 

§5.
1.
δίκην ταύτην] Attic prose would require ταύτην τὴν δίκην, unless we can regard δίκην as in apposition to ταύτην (‘he imposed this as a punishment’), in which case the article could not be used.

1,2. 
Κύρου...πέρι] Remember that when dissyllabic prepositions are placed after their noun, the accent is thrown back from the last to the first syllable.

4. 
ὅπῃ ἔκριναν. Strictly speaking we should expect the optative in a dependent question, but ἔκριναν represents the mood and tense actually employed by Astyages in oratio recta. Cf. on §4, 1. 11.

ταὖτα = τὰ αὐτά, ‘the same as before.’

5. 
χρῆν ἂν] transl. ‘it would have been necessary,’ the sentence being one of unfulfilled condition in past time. The imperfect χρῆν has often, as in this instance, to do duty for the aorist, since the latter tense is wanting.

7.
Ἔστι τε...καὶ περίεστι] ‘the boy lives and has survived,’ i.e., he is still alive in spite of my efforts to get rid of him.

19. 
τῇ σαυτοῦ μοιρᾷ] The instrumental dative, as if περίει, ‘you survive’ were a passive verb = ‘you are saved.’

20. 
ἴθι χαίρων] The participle of xalpw is constantly used in this way, especially with the verb ἀπαλλάττω, signifying not so much ‘rejoicing’ as ‘unharmed,’ ‘with impunity.’

21,22.
οὐ κατὰ Μιτ.] ‘not after the standard of,’ ‘of a very different kind to.’ 


C. The Manhood of Cyrus.

§1.
6. 
ἀνέπειθεν] ‘kept urging them.’ The preposition Ἀνά (properly ‘upon’ or ‘up’) when compounded with πείθω implies that the persuader has a difficult task. Our expression ‘uphill work’ perhaps illustrates the force of the Greek preposition. The task of Harpagus was naturally a difficult one, since he had to persuade the Medes not only to revolt against their king, but to do so in favour of Cyrus, a member of the rival Persian race. The same word is used in 1. 9, of Cyrus persuading the Persians, since it was no easy matter to induce a race to rebel which had for so long been used to the ascendancy of the Medes.

9.
ἀναπείσει] Notice the employment of the indicative in place of the optative, and cf. note on B, §5, 1. 4.

13.
ἔφη λέγων] ‘he went on to say’ (lit. ‘he said in his speech’).

14.
ἕκαστον ἔχοντα] accusative in apposition to ὑμᾶς the implied subject of the infinitive παρεῖναι. Similarly in 1. 19 λελουμένους, for which we might have expected the dative in agreement with αὐτοῖς, is in the accusative to agree with the subject implied in παρεῖναι.

19. 
ἐς τὴν ὑστεραίαν] ‘on the next day.’ In expressions of time ἐς (or εἰς) implies some future occasion and usually signifies ‘until.’ Properly speaking it retains that meaning here, for they were to wait until the morrow, and then come.

24,25. 
ἐπεί ἀπὸ δείπνου ἦσαν] ‘when they had finished dinner,’ a favourite idiom in Herodotus.

27.
πολὺ εἶναι τὸ μέσον] ‘the difference was great indeed.’ τὸ μέσον, lit., ‘the space between,’ ‘the interval.’

28. 
πάντα σφι κακὰ ἔχειν] ‘brought to them (lit, had for them) all sorts of evils.’ Σφι, a shortened form of σφίσι, is not Attic.

33. 
ἔχουσιν] Dat. plural, referring to ὑμῖν.

§2
2. 
ἠλευθεροῦντο] The full force of the middle (not passive) voice, and of the imperfect tense must be given in translation. ‘Set about freeing themselves.’


3,4. 
ἐπύθετο Κῦρον πράττοντα] ‘learnt that Cyrus was doing.’ Remember that after verbs of perceiving, knowing, ascertaining, etc., the participial construction is used in Greek, and not the accusative with the infinitive.

6.
βουλήσεται] the indicative, the mood of the oratio recta, in place of the optative, the proper mood of the oratio obliqua; cf. on B, §4, 1. 11.

10. 
τοῦ λόγου] ‘the secret,’ ‘the conspiracy.’ 


23.
ἐς ὅ] ‘until,’ lit. ‘up to which (time).”


IX. Solon and Croesus.

The writings of Herodotus are full of references to the instability of human fortune; and he dilates upon this story of Croesus as a crowning instance. "Within a few weeks the prosperous and puissant monarch, master of untold treasures, ruler over thirteen nations, lord of all Asia from the Halys to the sea, was a captive and a beggar, the miserable dependant upon the will of a despot whose anger he had provoked. Such a catastrophe had something in it peculiarly calculated to excite the feelings of the Greeks.” (Rawlinson’s Herod., vol. I., p. 382.)

It is, of course, very doubtful whether Solon really visited Croesus, but it is generally acknowledged to have been possible chronologically. In any case the interest of the story does not depend on its historical correctness.

(a.)
1.
Ἐκδημήσας ὁ Σόλων] See Vocab. of proper names, Σόλων.

4,5. 
περιῆγον κατὰ τοὺς θησ.] ‘led him all round the treasures? κατὰ, lit. ‘downwards,’ is frequently used with the accusative to express ‘up and down,’ ‘all over,’ e.g., κατὰ πόντον, κατὰ τὴν πόλιν.

9.
νῦν ἵμερος ἐπῆλθέ με] ‘a desire has just now come upon me.’ This is one of not a few cases where we are obliged to translate the Greek aorist (accompanied by certain adverbs of time) by the ‘perfect with have,’ and not by the English preterite. Cf. ἤδη εἶδες in II. 9, 10, ‘you have already seen.’ πολλάκις εἶδον, ‘I have often seen.’ Ἵμερος is chiefly poetical; ἐπιθυμία is the common word for ‘desire’ in Greek prose.

9,10.
ἐπερωτᾶν εἴ τινα...εἶδες] ‘to ask whom you have by this time seen,’ etc. Εἴ τις, lit. ‘if anyone,’ is not unfrequently used in the sense of the dependent interrogative ὅστις, ‘who.’

10. 
Ἐλπίζων εἶναι] ‘thinking himself to be.’ Ἐλπίζειν, usually ‘to hope’, frequently signifies merely ‘to expect,’ whether of good or evil. It also comes to mean ‘to imagine, deem, consider,’ just as we often say in English, ‘I expect that is so.’ ‘To hope to be’ would require the future infinitive.

12. 
τῷ ὄντι] ‘the real truth.’

15-17. 
τοῦτο μὲν...τοῦτο δὲ] Adverbial, ‘In the first place — in the second place.’

16. 
καλοὶ τε κἀγαθοί] The phrase καλός τε κἀγαθός, καλὸς κἀγαθός, or even as a single word καλοκαγαθός, was used to imply the possession of all the qualities requisite in a gentleman. Hence οἱ καλοκαγαθοί often denoted simply members of the upper classes, whether they possessed the qualities implied by the term or not. The same is the case with the Latin optimates, and the Greek οἱ ἄριστοι, ‘the aristocracy’ (lit. the best men). The reverse process has taken place with the word ‘Gentlemen,’ which from signifying simply men of good birth or family (gens, a tribe or clan) has come to imply rather the possession of certain good qualities supposed to be characteristic of such persons.

19. 
τοὺς ἀστυγείτονας] Perhaps the Megarians, with whom the Athenians carried on a long warfare during the lifetime of
Solon.

20. 
ἀπέθανε] ‘he perished,’ or, ‘was slain.’ The passive of ἀποκτείνω is never used in good Greek prose, and its place is supplied by ἀποθνήσκω.

(b.)
2. 
ἴδοι] N.B. The optative, like the past tenses of the Latin subjunctive, is regularly used in an interrogative clause dependent on a past tense.

5. 
τοιάδε] i.e., such as I am about to describe; cf. on VIII. A, §1, 1. 6. 
καὶ δὴ καὶ] This combination of particles is frequently used in introducing some additional fact on which greater emphasis is laid than on what has preceded. ‘And moreover this story in particular,’ etc.


7,8.
τὴν μητέρα αὐτων] She was the priestess of Hera, as we learn from other sources.

10. 
ὑποδύντες] Notice that the strong aorist of the verb δύω has always the middle meaning.

15. 
ἄμεινον εἴη τεθνάναι μᾶλλον κ.τ.λ] Strictly speaking μᾶλλον is unnecessary after the comparative ἄμεινον; but the word ἄμεινον, like the Latin saepius, was so often used almost in a positive sense (cf. XII., 1. 9, οὐ γὰρ ἄμεινον = it is not well) that μᾶλλον became almost necessary to impart the full comparative signification, These gloomy views about the miseries οf existence seem to have been prevalent among many of the Greeks living about the time of Solon. They are not found in the earliest known Greek literature, the poems of Homer, and they are in no wise prominent in the great writers of the fifth century B.C., such as Pindar and the dramatic poets.

17, 18. 
τὴν μήτερα (ἐμακάριζον) οἵων κ.τ.λ] ‘congratulated the mother for boing possessed of such children,’ lit. ‘for what sort of children she possessed.’

24. 
ποιησάμενοι] Notice the middle ‘made for themselves,’ or perhaps ‘got made for themselves’ (cf. διδάσκεσθαι, to get some one taught, as distinct from διδάσκειν, to teach).

25.
ἀνδρῶν...γενομένων] Not genitive absolute, but in apposition to αὐτῶν.
 

(c)

3.
τὸ μηδὲν] Often used of what is practically worthless. It is commonly said that οὐ negatives facts, and μὴ conceptions; thus τὸ οὐδέν would signify that which is absolutely non-existent, while τὸ μηδέν is that which is conceived to be as good as nothing. 

6,7. 
ἐπιστάμενον...πέρι] It is convenient to turn this sentence slightly: ‘Knowing well that divine power is altogether envious (of human happiness) and disposed to bring trouble upon us, I am questioned by thee,’ etc. 

11,12. 
σκοπεῖν τὴν τελευτὴν...πῇ ἀποβήσεται] ‘to consider how the end will turn out.’ When verbs of knowing, perceiving, etc., have an interrogative sentence dependent upon them, the subject of the dependent clause usually is first introduced as the object of the principal verb. Thus ‘I know who you are’ is in Greek Οἶδα σὲ ὄστις εἶ (lit., I know you who you are). 

12.
ὑποδείξας] ‘giving a glimpse of.’ The force of ὑπο compounded with a verb is often that an action is done surreptitiously or quietly.

12,13. 
πολλοῖς...ἀνέτρεψε] ‘to many men God gives one short glimpse of happiness, end then destroys thom root and branch.’ There is another similar passage in Herod., ‘God, after giving one taste of happiness in life, is found to be envious therein (ὁ θεὸς γλυκὺν γεύσας τὸν αἰῶνα φθονερὸς ἐν αὐτῷ εὑρίσκεται ὤν).’ Notice that the aorist ἀνέτρεψε must be translated by the present tense. It is an example of what is called the ‘gnomic’ aorist, because it was commonly employed in general precepts or proverbs (Γνῶμαι). It expresses that a thing has always happened in past instances, and continues to do so in the present. In English we pay attention to the latter and so use the present tense; while the Greeks fixed their attention on the past instances and employed the aorist.

(d.)
1. 
Νέμεσις is ‘deserved retribution,’ such as the Greeks held to be constantly brought upon a man by the gods, when excessive prosperity had led him to pride or presumption. Solon (p. 24, ¢, 1. 6) had described divine power as φθονερόν, ‘envious,’ implying that the gods took a malicious pleasure in overthrowing human prosperity, whether misused or not; he should rather, according to the more orthodox views of the ancients, have said νεμεσητικόν, ‘retributive,’ implying that the action of the gods was regulated by justice.

2. 
ὡς εἰσκάσαι] ‘presumably’; an adverbial expression. See ὡς in Vocab.

8. 
ἑστῶται] Beginners should be cautioned against regarding ἑστώς as a ‘syncopated’ form of ἑστηκώς, a term sometimes erroneously applied to it. Ἑστώς is contracted from ἑστα-ώς, ἑστα- being the stem of the 2nd perfect, while ἑστηκ- is that of the 1st perfect.

8,9. 
τῷ Κροίσῳ...ἐσῆλθε...τὸ τοῦ Σ. ὡς εἴη κ.τ.λ] The order for translation into English is τῷ Κ. ἐσῆλθεν ὡς τὸ τοῦ Σ. εἴη κ.τ.λ, ‘It came into the mind of Croesus that the (saying) of Solon, that none of living men are happy, was uttered with divine inspiration,’ 

10.
τὸ τοῦ Σόλωνος] The neuter article is attached to the phrase ‘Μηδένα...ὄλβιον,’ this being treated as a single substantive — ‘the (statement that) no-one,’ etc.

12. 
ἐκ πολλῆς ἡσ.] ‘after a long silence.’

μετὰ] adverbial. See Vocabulary.

16. ἔλθοι...ἀποφλαυρίσειε...ἀποβέβηκοι] Be careful to give the force of these tenses in translation, remembering that in oratio obliqua the tenses of the optative or infinitive have the same time-force as the corresponding tenses of the indicative, which would be employed in oratio recta. Cf. on xix. 1. 16.

20. 
παρ' ἑαυτοῖς] ‘in their own eyes.’

(e.) 
6. 
τὴν ταχίστην] ‘as quickly as possible,’ See Vocab. ταχύς.

14. 
ὗσεν] Impersonal; see Vocab., ὕω


Χ. Reverence For Suppliants.

1.
Πακτύης] Pactyes was a Lydian whom Cyrus, after he had defeated Croesus and captured Sardis, appointed to collect the treasure of the rich inhabitants, Pactyes, however, after Cyrus had departed seized the opportunity of organizing serious revolt against the Persians. Cyrus sent back a Persian army against him, and he was forced to fly.

4. 
θεὸν τὸν ἐν Βραγχίδαις] The god was Apollo; and splendid rains still remain at Branchidae of the temple here mentioned.

8. 
μέλλοιεν] The optative is regularly used in interrogative sentences which are dependent on a verb in past time. Notice that the future infinitive is the proper construction in prose after μέλλω.

13. 
ἔσχε μὴ ποιῆσαι] ‘withheld the Cymaeans from doing.” Verbs expressing prevention, or denial, doubt, refusal, etc., are usually followed, not by the simple infinitive, but by the infinitive accompanied by the negative μή which must not be translated in English. In such cases the Greeks had in their minds, not the action which is prevented, but the negative result attained.

15.
ἐς ὅ] ‘until,’ lit. until which (time). Cf. ἐς τόδε in 1. 22.

18. 
ἐκ πάντων ‘on behalf of them all,’ lit. (chosen as spokesman) ‘out of them all.’

27. 
ἐκ προνοίας] ‘of aforethought,’ ‘designedly.’ ἐκ often used with a substantive, or its equivalent, in place of a simple adverb, e.g., ἐκ τοῦ ἐμφανοῦς = ἐμφανῶς, ‘openly.’ Closely analogous is the usage of our ‘of’ in adverbial phrases such as ‘of course,’ ‘of one’s own accord,’ ‘of malice prepense.’

29. 
ἄλλα ὅσα...γένη] In translation γένη must be taken with ἄλλα; but in Greek, as in Latin, the antecedent is very frequently placed in the relative clause, instead of outside it as in English.

This story illustrates for us the fact that the oracles of the Greeks, whatever their shortcomings, staunchly maintained, in early times at any rate, the highest principles in the code of Greek morality and religion, Cf. on VII. b, 1. 5.

 

XI. Captures of Babylon. 

A. Capture by Cyrus.

The river Euphrates flowed right through the centre of Babylon, and Queen Nitocris, according to Herodotus’ account, carried on extensive operations both for the improvement of the river banks, and to secure easy communication between the two portions of the city. First of all she had an enormous hollow basin excavated at the side of the river above the city. She then had blocks of stone and burnt brick placed in readiness along the banks within the city. This done, the stream of the Euphrates was diverted into the basin, or hollow lake, so that the channel in the city below might be temporarily let dry. The workmen immediately set about constructing an embankment along each side of the river in the city, and a large stone bridge to connect the two divisions of the town. So long did the lake take to fill, and so rapid were the operations of the men, that they had concluded their task before the river had returned to its ordinary channel. Such is the account given by Herodotus, and it has been mentioned here to enable readers to understand the stratagem by which Cyrus captured Babylon.

5. 
σιτία ἐτῶν...πολλῶν] ‘provisions for many years.’

10, 11. 
ὅταν...ἵδωσι] The construction of the oratio recta is retained, instead of being converted to the ὅτε...ιδοιεν of oratio obliqua. Cf. on VIII. A, §3, 1. 7.

17. 
ἐπ' αὐτῷ τούτῳ] ‘for this very purpose.’ With this usage of επὶ, lit. ‘on,’ we may compare the English phrase, ‘on this errand,’ ‘on this mission,’ etc.

23.
τὰς πυλίδας] the gates set where gaps were left in the masonry of the embankments, to admit of approach to the river from the streets.

30. 
ἑορτή] It is generally supposed that this refers to the feast of Belshazzar, described in Dan. c. v. There is, however, some degree of uncertainty about the matter.

τοῦτον τὸν χρόνον] ‘during all this time.’


B. Re-capture of Babylon by Darius. 

§1.

Cyrus was succeeded by his son Cambyses, but on the death of the latter, the Medes obtained a temporary ascendancy under one of the Magi, who pretended to be Smerdis, a brother of Cambyses. The Persians eventually recovered their supremacy, and Darius, a Persian of high rank, became king. During these discussions however, the Babylonians found an opportunity for a well-prepared rebellion, which, as we read in this passage, was only repressed with the greatest difficulty.

10,11.
φροντίζοντας οὐδὲν etc.] Their confidence on this, as on the former occasion, arose from the strength of their fortifications. In ancient times any tolerably well-fortified city, carefully guarded, seems to have been practically impregnable; and starvation or stratagem were usually the only means by which its capture could be effected. Even the little city of Plataea in Boeotia, with a mere handful of soldiers, was able to resist the most vigorous attacks of a large army of the best Greek warriors, and only submitted when the supply of food was exhausted.

28. 
καὶ δὴ καὶ τούτῳ κ.τ.λ.] ‘and indeed especially that also,’ etc. καὶ following after the adverb ἄλλως or any part of ἄλλος accompanied by τε, always lays particular emphasis on what follows, and may be translated ‘and especially.’

οὗτος as the antecedent to ὅς must often be translated not as ‘this’ but ‘that,’ ἐκεῖνος being less commonly employed in this case.

§2.
2. 
τόδε] ‘the following.’ See on VIII. A, §1, 1. 6.

5. 
πρὸς τὰ...ῥήματα] ‘bearing in mind’ etc., lit. ‘with reference to,’ ‘having regard to.”

7, 8. 
σὺν γὰρ θεῷ...τεκεῖν] ‘for he thought that the man’s remark, together with (τε...καί) the fact of his mule having foaled pointed to the intervention of providence,’ lit. ‘he thought that both that man spoke, and his mule foaled under divine influence (σὺν θεῷ).’

10,11. 
περὶ πολλοῦ ποιεῖται] ‘reckoned at a high value,’ ‘attached much importance to.’ περί is constantly employed in phrases of this kind, and in accordance with the literal meaning of the preposition “the notion is, strictly, that the thing belongs to the sphere or region of great, small, etc.” (Lid. and Scott.)

23. 
ὅτι μὴ] ‘except.’ See Vocab. ὅτι.

34,35.
ἐπ' ἐμαυτοῦ βαλόμενος] ‘on my own responsibility,’ lit. ‘casting it over in my own mind.’ The phrase is not Attic.

35. 
ἐὰν μὴ τῶν σῶν δεήσῃ] ‘if there be nothing lacking on thy part’ (τὰ σά), i.e., if you carry out properly your share in my stratagem.


§3.

2.
ὑπὸ σοῦ τάδε ἔπαθον] ‘I suffered this treatment at your hands.’ ὑπό with the genitive, expressing the agent, is usually found in connection with a passive verb; but it is often employed with neuter verbs also where a passive meaning is implied; thus ἔπαθον ὑπό = ‘I was treated by,’ ἀπέθανεν ὑπό = ‘he was killed by.’ The literal meaning of ὑπό expressing the agent is not really ‘by,’ but ‘under the influence of,’ and thus it can accompany a neuter verb as naturally as a passive one, For τάδε, ‘such as follows,’ we might have expected ταῦτα, ‘such as you have seen’; but the meaning really is ‘such as I shall go on to describe to them.’

6. 
μοι] dativus commodi, signifying ‘for my benefit.’ We can empioy in this instance a similar dative in English, ‘place me the Persians against the gates’ etc.

15,16.
τά τε ἄλλα...καὶ δὴ καὶ] Cf. on §1, 1. 23.

17. 
τὸ ἐντεῦθεν] adverbial, ‘as to what follows.’


§4.

4. 
τὴν ἑτέραν πύλην] ‘one of the two gates,” cf. alter consulum, ‘one of the two consuls.’

13. 
ἀγαθόν] used as a substantive, ‘gain,’ ‘benefit.’

28.
παρέλαβεν...συνεθήκατο] aorists with a pluperfect force. Cf. on VIII. B, §3, 1. 10.

27, 28. 
Μαθόντες...παρεχόμενον] ‘Learning that he displayed deeds that matched his words.’ Μανθάνω takes the participial construction in place of the accusative with infinitive; cf. on VIII C, §2, 1. 3.

33. 
Ζώπυρον...στόμασιν] ‘had the name of Zopyrus on their lips.’

36, 37.
πάντα δὴ ἦν, κ.τ.λ.] ‘Ζ. was everything to the Babylonians.’

45. 
Τῶν Βαβυλωνίων, οἵ μὲν...οὗτοι] ‘Those of the Babylonians who,’ etc. Cf. note on οὗτοι, §1, 1. 23.

 
§5.

2. 
έκράτησε = the English pluperfect.

5. 
μάλιστα ἐς τ.] ‘to the number of about 3000.’

9,10. 
οὔτε τῶν ὕστερον...οὔτε τῶν πρότερον] ‘either of later or of earlier times.’ οὔτε...οὔτε must not in this passage be translated ‘neither ... nor,’ since we have already had one negative in οὐδείς. For the accumulation of negatives in Greek, cf. on VIII. A, §1, 1. 16.

13. 
ἀπαθῆ τὴς αἰκίας] adjectives in which a privative forms part of the compound are regularly accompanied by the genitive; e.g. κακῶν ἄγευστος, ‘without-a-taste-of evils’; ἄμιγεῖς βαρβάρων, unmixed-with barbarians.’


15,16. 
δῶρα...τιμιώτατα] ‘(Such) gifts as are held in most esteem among the Persians.’ Notice the imperfect ἐδίδου, of gifts renewed each year, in contrast to ἔδωκεν in the next line.

15.
ἀνὰ πᾶν ἔτος] distributive, ‘every year.’ Ἀνά, lit. ‘up,’ is often used in the sense of ‘from top to bottom,’ hence ‘throughout’ any place or space of time, e.g. ἀνὰ πᾶσαν τὴν ἡμεραν, ‘all through the day.’ Then by an easy transition it comes to imply that some action in itself momentary happens throughout a repetition of similar periods, e.g. ἀνὰ πᾶσαν ἡμέραν, ‘every day.’


XII. Tomb of Queen Nitocris.

Nitocris has already been mentioned at the beginning of the notes on No. XI. A.

3. 
κατεσκευάσατο] The force of the preposition in this word is worth noticing. It implies that the thing which is spoken of as built or got ready is intended for a fixed and permanent structure. Thus the noun κατασκευή is used of ‘fixtures’ in contrast to παρασκευή, or ‘moveable furniture or goods.’

8. 
Μὴ σπανίσας γε] equivalent to a conditional clause, ἐάν γε μὴ σπανίση, hence μή and not οὐ is the appropriate negative with the participle.

9. 
ἄλλως] ‘for any other reason.’
οὐ γὰρ ἄμεινον] sc. ἐστι, ‘for it is not well,’ lit. ‘better,’ but ἄμεινον in this phrase has almost lost its comparative force. Compare IX. b, 1. 15, note, where ἄμεινον is strengthened by μᾶλλον to give it its full comparative signification. The expression οὐ γὰρ ἄμεινον was evidently a stock phrase which had been in use probably for centuries before the time of Herodotus, since it is found in several passages in Epic hexameters, forming, it will be observed, the last two feet of the line.

11. 
καὶ δεινὸν...καὶ χρημάτων κ.τ.λ] Notice that the first καὶ (‘both’) is somewhat misplaced, as it belongs not to δεινὸν ἐδόκει, but to μηδὲν χρῆσθαι, ‘It seemed a great pity both to make no use of the gates,’ etc. Δεινός (from δέος, ‘fear’) lit. fearful,’ ‘terrible,’ ‘awful,’ is often used in Greek literature like these English words in their colloquial or ‘slang’ signification; so here δεινὸν resembles such expressions as ‘an awful shame’ or ‘a terrible pity.’ Of course, however, it would not do to translate in this manner, since this would be translating into English ‘slang’ what the Greeks did not regard as such at all.

14.
οὐδὲν] adverbially, ‘not at all.’

15. 
ὅτι ὕπερ, κ.τ.λ.] ‘because the compse would be above his head as he drove through.’ διεξελαύνοντι = εἰ διεξήλαυνεν, 80 that the sentence is one which implies an unfulfilled condition.

19. 
ἀνέῳγες] imperfect from ἀνοίγω (or ἀνοίγνυμι). Tt is doubly augmented like ἑώρων from ὁράω, and the aorist ἑάλων from the root ἁλ.


XIII. The Babylonian Wife-Market.

1. 
Κατὰ κώμας ἑκαστας] ‘throughout,’ or ‘in every village.” Κατά, lit. ‘down,’ is often used with the accusative, like the opposite, ἀνά, ‘up,’ in the sense of ‘up and down,’ ‘all through,’ hence distributively of something that takes place throughout a number of individual instances. (Cf. on XI. §5, 1. 15.) Similarly κατὰ μίαν ἑκάστην in 1. 4 = ‘one by one.’

2. 
ὅσαι...γίγνοιντο] the optative implies indefinite frequency in past time. ‘As many maidens as became (each year) ripe for marriage.’ In the next clause translate the words in the order : ταύτας ἐσῆγον ἐς ἕν χω. ἀθρ. ὅπως συναγ. πάσας. 

8. 
ἐπὶ συνοικήσει] ‘for marriage.’ For this usage of ἐπί, cf. on XII. A, 1. 17.

12,13. 
Ὡς...διεξέλθοι] the aorist retains its pluperfect signification with ὡς (see note on viit. B, §3, 1. 20) even though it is in the optative mood, to express indefinite frequency (cf. on 1. 2). ‘After the herald had (on each occasion) sold off all (lit. gone through in his sale) the .nost beautiful,’ etc.

18. 
ἐξεδίδοσαν] ‘gave in wedlock,’ since the money by which the beautiful brides were bought, enabled husbands in their turn to be bought for the ugly.


XIV. Stories of the Alcmaeonid Family.

2. 
ἀπὸ] ‘from the time of,’ ‘after.’

9. 
ἐνδὺς] Notice the distinction between the active ἐνδύω χιτῶνα, ‘I put a tunic on (someone else)’ and ἐνδύομαι χιτ., ‘I put it on myself.’ ένδύς, however, although an active form, signifies ‘having put on (himself),’ because the second or strong aorist active has the signification of the middle.

10,11. 
οὕς ηὕρισκεν ὄντας] ‘which he found to be.’ The participle and not the infinitive, is used after εὑρίσκω, because it has the force of a verb of perception. Cf. on VIII. C, §2, 1. 3.

15. 
μετὰ δὲ] adverbial, = ἔπειτα δὲ.
πλησάμ. τοῦ χρυσοῦ] ‘having filled with the gold,’ see Vocab., πίμπλημι.

16.
διαπάσας τοῦ ψήγματος] ‘some of the gold-dust,’ partitive genitive.


(b.)
3.
γυναῖκα] in apposition to ταύτην, ‘to bestow her as wife.’

4. 
Ὀλυμπίων...ὄντων] the Olympic games were a religious festival in honour of Zeus. They took place every four years at Olympia in Elis, a western district of the Peloponnese, and they were regarded as the greatest periodical ceremony in the Hellenic world. During their celebration all warfare between Greek states was supposed to be in abeyance, and the Greeks of the highest rank crowded to the performance from every Greek city and colony around the coasts of the Mediterranean. Consequently Cleisthenes could have chosen no more suitable occasion for finding a distinguished husband for his daughter.

4. 
νικῶν] We might have expected the aorist νικήσας, ‘having conquered,’ but the present νικῶν perhaps expresses ‘while celebrating his victory,’ for such an event was usually followed by a feast and thanksgiving service to a god, accompanied by songs composed specially for the occasion often by the best living poets.

7. 
ὡς κυρώσοντος, κ.τ.λ.] ‘on the understanding that Cleisthenes would,’ etc. See on VIII. B, §3, 1. 15.

10. 
μνηστῆρες] appositional, ‘came as suitors.’

11. 
ὁ Ἀλκμαιῶνος] supply υἷος, the phrase being so common that the noun was taken for granted. In the next line the article also is omitted, Ἱππ. Τισάνδρου.

15. 
ἀνεπύθετο] The preposition ἀνά when compounded with a verb has an intensifying force, ‘made thorough enquiries about.’ This is easily traceable from the literal meaning ‘up,’ hence ‘right up to the end.’

μετὰ δὲ] adverbial, = ἔπειτα δὲ.

κατέχων ἐνιαυτὸν] ‘keeping (them) for a year.’

16. 
αὐτων] gen. dependent on τῆς τε ἀνδρ. ...ὀργῆς are governed by διεπειρᾶτο, ‘made a trial of.’

24. 
Ὡς...ἐδείπνησαν] ‘when they had dined,’ see on VIII. §3, 1. 10.
μουσικῇ] the term includes both singing and playing and even dancing. Contests in these accomplishments were common among the Greeks from the earliest times, and were particularly popular as an after-dinner amusement among Greek gentlemen.

25,26.
κατέχων τοὺς ἄλλους] lit. ‘restraining the rest,’ probably in the sense of ‘holding them spell-bound.’

28. 
Καί πως...ὠρχεῖτο] ‘and he danced in a sort of manner which gave himself great pleasure.’

34. 
ἀποστυγῶν] ‘detesting the idea of Hipp. becoming his son-in-law,’ lit. ‘detesting (the thought) that H. should become’: ἂν γενέσθαι is of course the dependent form of ἂν γένοιτο.

40. 
φροντὶς] supply ἐστι.

41. 
σιγὴν ποιησάμενος] ‘having procured silence.’ The force of the middle is that he procured silence for himself, ie. to make himself heard, and thus the phrase is quite different from ὀργὴν or θαῦμα ποιεῖσθαι in XV. B, §3, 1. 5 (note).

43. 
οἷόν τε] to be taken together, see Vocab. οἷος.

46. 
πᾶσι κατὰ νοῦν ποιεῖν] ‘to act so as to suit the wishes of everybody.’ πᾶσι is the dativus commodi, ‘satisfactorily for everybody’: or the phrase may mean ‘to act according to my own inclinations in the interest of everybody.’


XV. Exploration of Africa.

A. The Pigmies

These Pigmies are apparently the same race of men as that discovered recently by Mr. Stanley in Central Africa, and thus have probably existed in that region for thousands of years. Mr, Stanley describes the dwarves as being about four ect in height, or a little more, and the words of Herodotus in 1. 32, μετρίων ἐλασσονες ἀνδρῶν, ‘smaller than men of medium size,’ correspond closely enough. Had the accounts given to Herodotus been purely fictitious, the love of the marvellous would probably have ascribed to the Pigmies a size very much further below that of ordinary mankind.

4. 
ἔχει φράσαι] ‘has (anything) to say about,’ etc., i.e. ‘is able to describe’ Cf. Vocab., ἔχω

8. 
ἀφίκοντο ἐς λέσχην] ‘fell into conversation about,’ ‘went on to talk about.’ ὡς ‘(saying) that,’ a verb such as λέγοντες being implied in the noun λέσχην.

11. 
πλέον λέγειν] ‘anything more than was already known,’ ‘anything new.’

13. 
ἄλλα τε μηχαν. ...καὶ δὴ καὶ] see on XI. B, §1, 1. 23, Transl.: ‘who, among other atrange objects, appointed by lot,’ etc. Notice the optatives μηχανῷντο, ἀποκληρώσειαν, due to the relative clause being in oratio obliqua.

15. 
ὀψομένους] The future participle often, as in this case, expresses purpose, and may be rendered by the present infinitive in English, ‘to explore.’

16. 
τὰ κατὰ τὴν βορείαν θάλασσαν] either ‘the region that stretches down to,’ or more probably ‘the region that stretches along the Northern Sea,’ κατὰ signifying extension up and down (cf. on IX. a, 1. 4), XIII. 1. 1. The Northern sea is of course the Mediterranean.

19. Ἕλληνες καὶ Φοίνικες referring to the Greek and Phoenician colonies on the north coast of Africa, chief of which were respectively Cyrene and Carthage.

19, 20. 
τὰ καθύπερθε] adverbial accusative, ‘in the regions beyond there.’

21. 
ψάμμος τε ἐστὶ, κ.τ.λ] Supply ἡ Λιβύη as the subject of ἐστὶ. ‘Libya is a sandy district and waterless to a wonderful degree,’ etc. Notice that τε...καὶ in this passage connect, not similar parts of speech, as is regularly the case, but a noun, ψάμμος, and an adjective, ἄνυδρος, ψάμμος being practically equivalent to the adjective ψαμμώδης.

25. 
τῆς οἰκουμένης] supply γῆς or χώρας; similarly with τὴν θηριώδη.

34, 35.
τὸ μέγεθος and χρῶμα are accusative of respect, ‘in size,’ etc.

39. 
δεδγλώσθω] “The perfect imperative is most common in the third person singular of the passive, where it expresses a command that something just done or about to be done shall be decisive and final.” (Goodwin's Moods and Tenses, p. 33.) Thus ταῦτα εἰρήσθω = ‘let this be said and no more.’

43. 
Νεῖλον] partly from the fact of there being crocodiles in it, and part from the direction of its course from west to east; for Herodotus goes on to use the following curious argument about the unknown course of the upper Nile: — The Nile, the greatest river in Africa, must correspond, he says, to the Danube, the greatest river known to him in Europe; and as the Danube flows for a long distance in its upper course from east to west, it is reasonable to conclude that the Nile does the same. The river here spoken of is more probably the Niger.


B. The Aethiopians. 

§l.
1,2. 
τοὺς Μακροβίους Αἰθίοπας] merely a mythical branch of the Aethiopian race.

2.
οἰκουμένους Λιβύης, κ.τ.λ.] λιβύης is the partitive genitive, ‘dwelling in (that part) of Libya (which is) on the Southern Sea.’

4,5. 
ὀψομένους τὴν...τράπεζαν...εἰ ἔστιν] The construction is equivalent to ὀψομ. εἰ ἡ...τράπεζα ἔστιν ‘to see if the sun’s table really exists.’ This accusative which may be called anticipatory is regularly used after verbs of perception; see on IX. (c) 1. 11. Τράπεζαν is used in this passage for ‘table,’ not in its literal meaning, but in the sense of ‘meal.’

6. 
τῷ λόγῳ] ‘professedly,’ ‘ostensibly.’

8.
Ἡ τράπεζα τοῦ ἡλιου] This is the only account we have of the so-called ‘Sun's Table.’ The myth, doubtless, had no such literal explanation as that given below by Herodotus, but was perhaps mere poetical fiction descriptive of the power of the sun in the Equatorial or neighbouring regions.

10,11.
τὰς νύκτας...τὰς...ἡμέρας] accusative not only expresses ‘time how long,’ but also, as in this case, the time during or within which.

14.
ἡ...τράπεζα...καλουμένη] ‘the so-called table of the sun.’ 

16,17. 
τῶν Ἰχθυ. ἀνδρῶν] partitive genitive, dependent on τινας. 

18. 
ἐπεὶ ἀφίκοντο] aorist for pluperfect; see on VIII. B, §3, 1. 10.

20. 
εἶμα] Gifts of clothing have always been common among Oriental people. In the Old Testament, for instance, Naaman bestows two changes of raiment on Gehazi, Elisha’s servant.

χρυσοῦν στρερτὸν περιαυχένιον] Two adjectives are not conmonly placed in agreement with a noun unconnected by a conjunction; but in this instance στρεπτὸν ia taken so closely with περιαυχένιον that the two words form a single idea, ‘a twisted-necklace.”

21. 
μύρου ἀλάβαστρον] another favourite gift among Orientals, the same present being offered to Our Lord in St. Matthew xxvi. 7, προσῆλθεν αὐτῷ γυνὴ ἔχουσα ἀλάβαστρον μύρου βαρυτίμου.

23-25. 
νόμοις δὲ καὶ ἄλλοις...τοιῷδε] ‘besides other customs different from (those of) the rest of mankind, they employ the following in particular in connection with the sovereignty. For καὶ ἄλλοις...καὶ δὴ καὶ, see on XI. B, §1, 1. 23; for κεχωρ. τῶν ἄλλων ἀνθρ. = κεχ. τῶν νόμων τῶν ἄλλων ἀνθρώπων, see on VIII. B, §2, 1. 17.

26. 
κατὰ τὸ μέγεθος, ‘in proportion to his stature.’

32, 33. 
οἷς...χρώμενος, ‘in the use of which he too takes special delight.’

34. 
κάτοπται] appositional, ‘as spies.’

35. 
Οὔτε, κ.τ.λ.] the negative properly belongs to βουλόμενος, ‘neither did the king send you...because he wished.’

39,40. 
οὔτ' ἂν...ἦγεν] notice the change from the aorist ἐπεθύμησε to the imperf., ‘neither would he be leading into slavery,’ as if Cambyses had already begun the process, the sending of the spies being the first step.

44. 
οὔτως εὐπετῶς] ‘as easily as (I do it),’ for he suits the action to the word (1.47).

45,46. 
ἐπὶ νοῦν τρέπ. Αἰθίοψι] ‘put it into the mind of the Aethiopians,’ lit. ‘for the Aethiopians.’

§2.
1. ἤρετο ὅτι εἴη] Why optative? See on x., 1. 8.

8. 
εἶσι] the mood as well as the tense of the oratio recta is often retained in the oratio obliqua, instead of being changed to the optative. Cf. ll. 13, 14, 17, and see on VIII. A, §3, 1. 7.

13,14. 
ὁπ. χρόνον μακρότατον] ‘how much time at the longest,’ or ‘what was the longest time that,’ etc.

17. 
Πρὸς ταῦτα] ‘thereupon.’ lit. ‘(in answer) to this.’

οὐδεν] adverbial.

18. 
κόπρον] alluding of course to the manure so essential in agriculture.

19. 
δύνασθαι] What would this be in the oratio recta? 

20. φράζων τὸν οἶνον] ‘referring to the wine.’ 

§3.
5. 
Θαῦμα ποιουμένων] ‘manifesting surprise.’ Herodotus frequently uses ποιεῖσθαι with a noun in this manner, when we might have expected a verb alone, e.g. in this case θαυμαζόντων. Similarly in §4, 1. 2, ὀργὴν ποιησάμενος = ὀργισθεις, ‘flying into a passion.’ Ποιεῖσθαι has the full force of the middle, lit. ‘to create, or, arouse wonder, anger, etc., in oneself.’

7. 
ὦζε] here used impersonally, ‘there was a smell from it, as of violets.’ The genitive (ἴων) is the usual cage after verbs relating to the senses of smell or taste.

8. 
ἄσθενες] lit. ‘weak,’ in the sense of the Latin tenuis, as the opposite of ‘gross.’ Thus the meaning here is ‘rarified,’

12. 13, 
διὰ τὸ ὕδωρ...μακρόβιοι ἂν εἶεν] ‘they are likely to be long-lived on account of this water,’ i.e. ‘this water is likely to be, or probably is, the cause of their long life.” ἂν εἶεν expresses that the writer is uncertain not about the fact of their long life, but as to whether it is really because of the water.

εἰ ἐστιν ἀληθῶς, etc.] ‘if what is reported really is a fact.’

14. 
Ἀπὸ τῆς κρήνης δὲ] Regularly δέ comes second in its clause, but the words ἀπὸ τῆς κρ. are so closely connected grammatically as to form practically a single word.

16. 
ἐδέδεντο] ‘had been bound,’ when cast into prison; but it is practically equivalent to the simple past tense ‘were bound,’ or were lying bound.’

§4 
2. 
ὀργὴν ποιησ. See on §3, 1 5. 

5. 
οἷα...ὢν] ‘just as if he were.’ οἷα, adverbial. 

5,6. ὡς ἤκουε] Cf. on VIII. B, §3, 1. 10.

8. 
αὐτίκα...ἐπελελοίπειν] the pluperfect where we might expect the aorist represents the situation more graphically, ‘suddenly (they found that) the bread had failed them.’

10, 11. 
εἰ...ἐγνωσιμάχει καὶ ἀπῆγεν...ἦν ἂν] In spite of the imperfect, ‘we must render this as an unfulfilled condition in past time, ‘if he had adopted a different resolution, and had led his army back, he would have been,’ etc. The imperfect is
used instead of the aorist because the action implies continuity.

11, 12. 
ἐπὶ τῇ...ἁμαρτάδι] Ἐπὶ is here temporal; from ‘upon’ it comes to mean ‘following close upon,’ ‘behind,’ hence ‘after.’

12. 
νῦν δὲ] ‘but as things were,’

13. 
οὐδένα λόγον ποιούμενος = οὐδὲν λογιζόμενος] ‘without taking any consideration.’ Cf. above on §3, 1. 5.


XVI. The Victory of Salamis.

§1

1. 
ὡς ἐξηγγέλθη] aorist in pluperfect sense. Cf. on VIII. B, §3, 1. 10.

2.
ὡς ἔσχε τὰ περὶ κ.τ.λ.] ‘how affairs stood with regard to,’ etc. ἔσχε, intransitive.

4. 
ὡς ἀποθευσόμενοι] ‘with the intention of,’ etc. See on VIII. B, §3, 1. 15. 

5.
τοῦ Ἴσθμου] the Isthmus of Corinth.

6. 
καὶ οἵ] ὅς is here used as a demonstrative. See Vocab.

9. 
εἴη] optative because in an interrogative clause dependent on a past verb.

12. 
ἄρα] has its force of ‘contrary to expectation’ (see on VI., 1. 29, VIII. A, §3, 1. 3), thus, ‘you think you are going to fight for Greece at the Isthmus, but you will find that you will have no fatherland at all to fight for’

14. 
ἕκαστοι] the plural implies collective bodies of men, ‘the men of each state.’

18. 
ἀναγνῶσαι] ‘to win over.’ ἀνὰ in this verb os in ἀναπείθεσθαι (VIII. C, §1, 1. 6) has the force of ‘winning back to one’s side or opinion.’ Notice that ἀναγιγνώσκω in Attic Greek never has this meaning, but signifies ‘I read.’


§2.

3. 
θέλειν] In Attic prose the longer form, ἐθέλειν, is more usual.

5.
εἴ τι θέλει] “if he has anything to say.’ The mood of the orafio recta is retained, instead of being changed to the optative. Cf. on VIII. A, §4, 1. 7.

6. 
καταλέγει] ‘goes through in detail.’

10. 
Ὡς δὲ ἄρα, ‘and when actually.” Cf. above on §1, 1. 12.

11. 
τὸν λόγον ὧν ἕνεκα = τὸν λόγ. τούτων ὧν ἕν., ‘his account of those things for the sake of which,’ transl. ‘his reasons for assembling,’ etc.
συνήγαγε] has a pluperfect force.


§3.

1.
Τότε μὲν] ‘at that time on the one hand’ implies ἔπειτα δὲ, ‘but afterwards.’ This subsequent occasion occurs in §4, 1. 6 seq.

3. 
Ἐν σοὶ...ἐστι] ‘It rests with you.’

6,7. 
τὰ εἰκότα  ἐκ τοῦ πολέμου] ‘the probable results of warfare.”

7. 
πολὺ κρατήσομεν] ‘we shall have a great advantage’: πολὺ, adverbial.

8. 
πρὸς ἡμῶν] 
‘in our favour,’ lit. ‘from our side,’ i.e, ‘belonging to our side,’ ‘on our side.’

9. 
περιγίγνεται] ‘escapes’ by not falling at once into the hands of the enemy, as would be the case if the Greeks withdrew to the Isthmus.
ἐκείνων] i.e. the Persians.

10. 
καὶ μὴν] See Vocab., μήν

14. 
ὑμῖν] dativus incommodi, ‘to trouble you.”


§4.

6. 
Τότε δὴ] ‘then at last,’ after previously restraining his anger; see on §3, 1. 1.

8. 
ἕως ἂν...ὦσι] the construction of the oratio recta retained unchanged in the obliqua. Cf. on VIII. A, §4, 1. 7.

11. 
τῷ λόγῳ διέβαινεν] lit. ‘he crossed over in his remarks,’ i.e., ‘he transferred his remarks to,’ etc.

12,13. 
Σὺ εἰ...ἔσει] This sentence is merely the protasis of a conditional, with the apodosis or principal clause not expressed but implied. Thus: ‘if you will remain and play the man (all will be well).’ This usage occurs in not a few instances in Greek, where the implied apodosis admits of no doubt.

15. 
ὡς ἔχομεν] ‘as we are,’ i.e. without further hesitation; ἔχομεν, intrans.

16. 
ἡμετέρα] It is not certain upon what foundation this claim rested.

20. 
ἀνεδιδάσκετο] For the force of ἀνὰ cf. on ἀναγνῶσαι, §1, 1 18, and see Vocab.,


21,22. 
ἂν ἐγίγνοντο] We might expect rather the aorist in reference to past time. The imperfect, however, takes us back to the sentiments of Eurybiades, (He felt that) ‘they would be,‘’ etc.

22. 
ταύτην] explained by αὐτοῦ μέν. διαναυμ.

23. 
διαναυμαχεῖν] Notice the intensifying force of διὰ, ‘fight to the end.’


§5.

3. 
ἐς τὴν ὑστεραίαν] We must translate ‘on the morrow’ as if it were ἐν τῇ ὑστεραίᾳ, but ἐς is used like the Latin in with the accusative to express that something is done with a view to or looking ahead to a future occasion. ‘Against’ is sometimes used in a similar manner.

14. 
πλοίῳ] ‘in a boat,’ but the dative is probably instrumental with πέμπει, ‘sends by means of a boat.’

18,19. 
τυγχάνει βουλόμενος] ‘happens to wish.’ Notice the participial construction after τυγχάνω.

24. 
ἑαυτούς] is here used for ἀλλήλους, ‘each other.’

29. 
μέσαι νύκτες] ‘midnight.’ The plural of νύξ is constantly used, especially with μέσαι, where we might have expected the singular.

τὸ ἀφ' ἑσπέρας] ‘the western wing,’ more properly, the north-western wing. The Persian fleet had first taken up their position, according to Herodotus, off Phalerum, while the Greek fleet, as indicated in the Plan, lay in the harbour or bay off the town of Salamis. On receiving the message of Themistocles the whole Persian fleet was apparently moved upwards in a north-westerly direction so as to front the Greek fleet, cutting off also the chance of their retreat round the north of Salamis by the bay of Eleusis. It will be seen from the Plan that the south-eastern end could not be so closely occupied as the north-western, and thus Aristides was able to elude the Persian vessels.

§6.

5. 
ἐξωστρακισμένος] Ostracism was a peculiar form of banisttnent practised at Athens, which was introduced by the legislator Cleisthenes for the purpose of preventing party-strife from breaking out into civil war. When the animosity between two political factions and their leaders became excessive, the citizens were ordered to meet and each to inscribe on a tile or potsherd (ὄστρακον) the name of any citizen whom he thought a possible source of danger to the peace of the state. The man against whom the majority of votes was recorded, provided the total against him reached a certain number, was forced to go into exile for ten years. His property, however, was not confiscated as in ordinary cases of banishment, and the decision against him probably brought him little discredit. Aristides, who was the leader of what may be called the conservative party at Athens, had for three or four years been bitterly opposed to Themistocles, until the contention was ended by the ostracism of the former. It was Themistocles himself who, shortly before Salamis, had proposed the recall of all exiles, including Aristides.

8. 
στὰς ἐπὶ τὸ συνέδριον] ‘coming before the council.’ στὰς followed by ἐπί with the accusative, implies, ‘coming to the council and standing there.’

10,11. 
λήθην ποιούμενος, ‘assuming forgetfulness.’ Cf. on XV. B, §3, 1. 5.

15,16. 
ἔν τε τῷ ἄλλῶ...τῳδε] ‘on this occasion above all others.’ See on XI. B, §1, 1. 23.

16,17.
περὶ τοῦ ὁπότερος...ἐργάσεται] ‘as to which of us shall perform.’ The clause ὁπότερος...ἐργάσεται, is treated as a quasi-substantive to which the definite article τοῦ is prefixed, lit. ‘about the (question as to).’


§7. 

χηρστὰ διακελεύει] i.e. with regard to their working together for the common good (§6, 1. 15 etc.) 
2. 
ἄ implies an antecedent τούτων, genitive dependent on αὐτόπτης.
 
18,19. 
ἐπείθοντο τὰ ἐξαγγελθέντα] see Vocab. for construction.


§8.

2. 
ὡς ναυμαχήσοντες] ‘with the intention of,’ etc. For ὡς with the participle, see VIII. B, §3, 1. 15. 


4,5.
ἐπὶ πρύμναν ἀνεκρούντο] ‘were backing water,’ lit. ‘were thrusting, or rowing, back (their ships) sternwards.’ In 1. 12, the phrase is slightly varied, πρύμναν ἀνακρούεσθε, lit. ‘thrusting back the stern.’

5. 
Notice the force of the imperfects ἀνεκρούντο and ὤκελλον, ‘were just on the point of backing,’ etc.

11. 
μέχρι πόσου] supply χρόνου, ‘for how long?’


§9.

2.
τὸ...ἑσπέρας κέρας] the wing, properly on the northwest, which had been sent to cut off the retreat of the Greeks towards the Bay of Eleusis. Cf. on §5, 1. 29.

5. 
ἐν τῇ Σαλαμῖνι] In contrast to other vessels which were destroyed outside the straits while trying to escape from the scene of action to Phalerum. See §10, 1. 13.

7. 
σὺν κόσμῳ, κ.τ.λ. These words imply that the Greeks very quickly recovered from their panic, and fought not only with bravery, but with discipline and coolness; whereas the Barbarians, judging from the words οὔτε τεταγμένων ἔτι, etc., seem to have quickly lost heart, and although they fought strenuously (11. 10-13) they were apparently too excited to think of the proper tactics of naval warfare.

9. 
ἤμελλε, see μέλλω.

11. 
ταύτην τὴν ἡμέραν] adverbial, ‘throughout this day.’

μακρῷ] ‘by far’: πολύ is more usual in Attic prose.

πρὸς Εὐβοίᾳ] Referring to the engagements off Artemisium on the north coast of Euboea, where the Greek fleet had first been stationed.


§10.

6. 
τισιν] dativus incommodi. Transl. ‘If any had their ships destroyed.’

13. 
ἐκπλεόντων] i.e. ‘sailing out of the battle, or out of the straits.’

14. 
ὑποστάντες] Notice the force of the preposition. See Vocab., ὑπό when compounded with a verb.

19. 
φερόμενοι, ‘as they hastened on.’

21. 
ὑπὸ τὸν πέζον στράτον] ‘under the shelter of their land-force.’ It must be remembered that in those days ships of war were light enough to be beached and drawn up on the shore, and thus could be protected by a land-army.


XVII. Gold procured in India among Ant-Bears.

3. 
μέγεθος...κυνῶν ἔλασσον] ‘a size less than that of dogs.’ Cf. on VIII. B, §2, 1. 16.

8.
εἶδος] ‘in appearance,’ accusative of reference or respect.

11. 
σειραφόρον] This term is usually applied to an outside horse in a chariot-team which pulls by the trace only and not by the yoke. In this instance it signifies ‘a led-camel.’ These two male led-camels do not assist, it will be noticed, in carrying either the man or the burden, They are taken partly as a means of arresting the pursuit by sacrificing first one and then the other male camel to the ant-bears (1. 27), and partly, it would seem, because the female alone would have endeavoured to return home to her young ones before reaching the land of the ant-bears at all. It is somewhat surprising that Herodotus, who is usually so careful in the details of his descriptions, does not explain the matter more fully.

26.
προὐλάμβανον] contr. from προ-ελάμβανον.

28,29.
παραλύονται ἐφελκόμενοι, κ.τ.λ] ‘are set loose, when they begin to drag, but not both at the same time,’ in order that the pursuers may be twice delayed by a capture. Compare the tales of escapes from wolves in Russia.

30. 
ἐνδιδόασι μαλ. οὐδέν] ‘show no sign of flagging.’
 

XVIII. How the Spices of Arabia are Obtained. 

(a)
7. τὸ μέγεθος...τὸ εἶδος] accusative of respect, ‘in size,’ ‘in appearance.’

12. 
βύρσαις καὶ δέρμασιν ἄλλοις] Both βύρς. and δέρμ. signify ‘hides,’ but it is supposed that βύρσαις in this passage stands for ‘ox-hides,’ the commonest kind, and δέρμασιν ἄλλοις for ‘skins of other descriptions.’

16. 
τέτριγε δεινόν] ‘utter loud cries.’ For δεινὸν, lit. ‘fearful,’ see on XII. 1. 11; the perfect τέτριγε is used with a present meaning, and this usage is particularly common with verbs expressing a sustained cry or sound, the perfect denoting as usual a lasting state; e.g. κέκραγα, κέκληγα, both meaning ‘I cry, or shout.’

27,28. 
τὰ μέλη διατ. ὡς μέγιστα] ‘cutting up the limbs in as large pieces as possible.’ See Vocab., Ὡς.


3,4.
ἃς εἴ τις, κ.τ.λ] ‘and if one were to suffer them to drag these, they would have sores owing to their tails rubbing along the ground.’ The relative pronoun both in Greek and Latin must often, especially after a semicolon or full stop, be turned in English by ‘and’ with a demonstrative pronoun. Notice the apparent pun in ἐφέλκειν and ἕλκω which can hardly be represented in English.

6. 
ἐπίσταται...τοσοῦτο] ‘understand carpentering up to this point,’ i.e. sufficiently to prevent the tails from dragging; for τοσοῦτο strictly speaking refers not to what follows (i.e. in this case, the manufacture of the little carts), but, like οὗτος, to what precedes; cf. on VIII. A, §1, 1. 6.

8,9. 
καὶ ἐπὶ πῆχυν πλάτος] ‘(being) even as much as a cubit in breadth.’ ἐπὶ, ‘on to,’ ‘up to,’ ‘as far as,’ hence ‘as much as.” πλάτος, accus. of respect.


XIX. Scythian Prophets, etc.

2.
ῥάβδοις] Prophecy by the aid of wands was once a wide-spread custom, found for instance among the Egyptians (Genesis c. vii.) the Chaldacans (Ezekiel xxi. 21), and the ancient Germans (Tacit. Germ. 10).

4. 
ἐπὶ μίαν...τιθέντες] ‘placing the wands each one behind another.’ Ἐπὶ is used especially in military phrases, either with the genitive or the accusative, to express ‘so many deep,’ e.g. ἐπὶ πολλοὺς τάσσειν = ‘to draw up a column many men deep’; ἐπὶ ὀκτὼ νῆας, of a fleet eight ships deep. 

5. 
ἅμα τε λέγοντες] ‘and while saying,’ see on VIII. B. §2, 1. 31.

6. 
κατὰ μίαν] ‘one by one,’ κατὰ being used distributively (see on XIII. 1.1). From the word αὖθις we may probably assume that the wands were not only placed ‘one by one’ but also ‘one behind the other’ (ἐπὶ μίαν) as before.

12. 
λέγοντες τῶν ἀστῶν, κ.τ.λ] ‘Mentioning (that one) of the citizens whomsoever they do mention.’

15. 
διελημμένος] see διαλαμβάνω

16. 
ἐπιορκῆσαι] Notice that when an infinitive (or an optative) is dependent on a verb of saying or the like, the tenses retain the full signification which they bear in the indicative. Thus ἐπιορκῆσαι is used here not because the action was a single or momentary one (usually the entire signification of the aorist when not in the indicative mood), but because the actual word used by the prophets was ἐπιώρκησε, ‘he foreswore’ on some past occasion. The same applies to φάμενος ἐπιορκῆσαι in 1.19. Cf. on ΙΧ. (d), 1. 16.

17. 
ἐπιορκήσας φαίνεται] ‘is shown (not, appears) to have foresworn,’ see Vocab., φαίνομαι, for distinction between φαίνομαι with infinitive and with participle.

19.
οὐ φαμένος ἐπ.] ‘declaring he has not,’ etc. In such cases οὐ, which properly belongs to the dependent verb in the infinitive, is placed closely before φημί, just as in Latin ‘nego me fecisse,’ = dico me non fecisse.

27.
