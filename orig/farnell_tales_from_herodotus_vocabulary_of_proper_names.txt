Subsequently he took an active part in carrying on the naval war to the islands of the Aegean Sea and the Greek cities in Asia Minor, most of which were now liberated from the Persian rule. He also induced the Athenians to surround their city by an almost impregnable wall, and to construct a magnificent harbour at Peiracus. He was thus the means of the Athenians becoming for a time the chief naval power in the world. Owing to party strife at Athens, he was ostracised in 471 Β.C., and was subsequently accused of intriguing treacherously with Persia.
